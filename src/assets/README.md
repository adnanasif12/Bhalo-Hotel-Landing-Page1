# Asset Images

The following images are available in the project:

- file.svg
- globe.svg
- next.svg
- vercel.svg
- window.svg

These are located in the `public` folder. To use them in your components, reference them as `/file.svg`, `/globe.svg`, etc.

If you want to add custom hotel images, place them in the `src/assets` folder and update this README accordingly.
